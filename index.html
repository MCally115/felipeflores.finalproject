    <h1>Colores</h1>
    <h2>By Felipe Flores</h2>
    <p>This is about a ball that meets another ball. They merge together. They continue their journey together, then they ran into a wall. The wall was a different color than the ball. The ball was unable to go because of this reason. So it just stood in place and vanished. I made it because I had to or else I would get a bad grade for my final. No it has nothing to do with politics. Does it look like a type of person to make something political?</p>
